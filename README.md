This repository accompanies the paper:

**“Contextual Earnings Analyzer (CEA): Capturing Nuanced Sentiment in Earnings Calls Using Advanced NLP Techniques”**  
Submitted to ICAIF 2025

## Description

This codebase implements the methodology described in the paper. It processes earnings call transcripts to extract sentiment signals using transformer-based NLP models and dictionary-based weighting schemes. The resulting features are used to construct asset pricing factors and evaluate portfolio performance.

Due to licensing restrictions, the raw earnings call transcripts obtained from Refinitiv Eikon are **not included**. However, all intermediate files required to replicate the results—including processed sentiment scores, word weightings, and portfolio returns—are included.
